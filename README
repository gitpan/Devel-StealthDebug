Devel::StealthDebug 
===================

This module was designed to assist you in the debugging process.

It will provide several functions to track/observe data changes. 

The interface curently used (filter) allow you to turn debugging features on/off
only through the 'use Devel::StealthDebug' line.

All debugging statements are put in comments.
This means that when there's no 'use Devel::StealthDebug', no debug INSTRUCTIONS are
present (I really mean 'present', not only 'enabled')
This make it really easy to send a version from the test environment to the prod 
environment (and vice versa)

This module is currently in alpha state.

INSTALLATION

Nothing really original here.

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

One last thing : Comments are REALLY welcome.

If you use this module, (dis)like it, don't hesitate to drop me
a mail to tell me what you think about it and how this module could be enhanced.
All points of view are worthy even if you feel like a newbie
(ESSPECIALLY if you're a newbie !)

	Test::More
