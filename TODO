- Make it clean (Hubris...)
	* Make the regexes consistent (and make them work)
	* Strengthen the code (find kind people to test it)
    * Be consistent with the die/emit/carp
	
- Make current features more cutomizable
	(set messages format...)

- Add (I mean find) new USEFUL features

- Add FileHandle method handling (TIEHANDLE, READ,...EOF)

_ Get the value of the watch'ed variable if the watch isn't on the initialization...
  (when value is "lost");
  
_ Add more tests (Hi ! fellow testers ;-)

_ Rethink the syntax (drop the surrounding ! ? prefix with DD_ ?)

- Document the 'use Devel::StealthDebug source=>"/path/to/file"' feature 
  (but first make it usable)

_ Explicitly describe some pitfalls

_ Add an unwatch() fonction ?

_ Review(rewrite) dumpvalue which was rewritten 'a la va-vite' just before release.
  I'm not too proud of this part...

_ Add the 'enable' directive proposed by Tim BUNCE
