0.006 Add some more tests, fix some bugs

1.000 Renamed the module and thought to release it as the first public version

1.001 Tim BUNCE's special edition ;-)
	 	(FIRST PUBLIC VERSION RELEASED)

      Implemented few suggestions, renamed some methods according to his 
	  comments on the modules list.
	  
	  	show  -> dump
	  	wait  -> when
	  	print -> emit
	  	emit  -> emit_type
		
	  Added some tests.

	  And renamed this module (again) to its final name Devel::StealthDebug.

1.002 Yann KEHERVE's special edition (Yes, it's now a tradition)

		Thanks to his feedback, I 
		
	  Corrected some typos, completed the doc.
	  Corrected a bug with watch() under use strict.

1.003 Adam FOXSON's special edition

	  Modified the dump() function to display hash sorted by keys
	   (mainly to make t/dump.t consistent on different boxes)
	  Added the ENABLE feature on the use line (Idea from Tim Bunce, and
	  also asked by Yann...)

1.004	  Modified t/emit_type2.t to create file 'mydebug' in the test dir.
          (now remove it after the test)
